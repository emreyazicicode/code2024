How can we measure quality of the data
- how many nulls in the column, what is ratio of being null(!) --> bad
- what is the "age" of the data (business, database) --> kohne --> bad
- what is the "source" of the data (income), (bank cashier 3.000, customer, government) reliable --> good
- are there any inconsistencies? (relation)
- range (range of values, are they in correct range) [outlier], 
- valid date, time, email
- randomly select & verify


How can we keep the data with high quality (ensure)
- we can periodically check the upper statements
- Data Drift Management
